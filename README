Description
    Implementation of the dynamic Smagorinsky model with coefficients cD and
    cI computed as local average of their face values to avoid numerical
    instabilities.
    Negative values of the effective viscosity are removed by clipping it to
    zero (nuSgs is clipped to -nu)

Target platform
    The code is known to work with OpenFOAM v2012.
